# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping software. We want to keep it
as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your
environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow
so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Submitting Changes

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/localhost-technology/Foundation.ManagedScope).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the localhost.technology organization.
* Update your issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed.
  * Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
* The company team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
  weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
