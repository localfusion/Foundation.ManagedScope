# Foundation.ManagedScope
# Library that wraps built in scopes and structures 

Welcome to Foundation.ManagedScope source code repository.

Foundation.ManagedScope, or simply ManagedScope, is a cfml based library that adds datatypes and validation to structures and form/url built in scopes. It is a wrapper for these structures and allows to define valid datatypes and tokens for each key.

ManagedScope is of course open source (Apache) and available for free!
